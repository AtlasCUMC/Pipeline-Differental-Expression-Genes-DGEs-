# Pipeline-Differental-Expression-Genes-DGEs-

We developed a pipeline for Differental Expression Genes (DGEs) based on DESeq (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106). We developed a R script to do a automatic analysis based on DESeq R library. It need only a count file with no header for sample of your interest.

# Require R library

DeSeq:  https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq.html
Data.table: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html


## Usage

First downlaod the code and the database:

git clone https://github.com/Atlas9266/Pipeline-Differental-Expression-Genes-DGEs-.git
